    <p className="text-gray-500 text-xl text-center md:text-2xl">Hello! I am a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong focus on building responsive and dynamic web applications. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and SCSS, and I enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces with modern technologies like Tailwind CSS. I specialize in creating interactive and performant websites using JavaScript and React, and I am always excited to dive deeper into the world of frontend development.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-500 text-xl text-center md:text-2xl">I have commercial experience in building a React application that is currently being used by a company. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in real-world conditions and understand the importance of maintaining and optimizing software products in a business environment.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-500 text-xl text-center md:text-2xl">Recently, I have also started exploring Node.js (basic knowledge) for backend development, and I am currently working with Next.js to build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications. My goal is to continue growing my skills in both frontend and backend development, creating seamless and high-quality user experiences.</p>
